<h3>Share and Care GUIDELINES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES</h3><br>
The following guidelines are intended to inform law enforcement about the legal process for seeking records from Share and Care. These are 
merely guidelines, and this information may change at any time. For private party requests, including requests from civil litigants 
and criminal defendants, we recommend browsing Guidelines for Third Party Data Requests.

<h3>WHAT IS UBER AND WHAT RECORDS DO WE HAVE?</h3><br>
Share and Care is a technology company that has developed an app that connects users (riders) with driver partners who provide transportation 
to the user. Share and Care is not a transportation carrier, and does not employ any drivers. Users can use the  share and care website to request 
transportation via their smartphone, the web, or via SMS. Share and Care users can choose from a variety of drivers available in his or her 
location. At the end of the ride, both the driver partner and user receive a copy of the fare receipt. More information about our 
services is available here. We store and maintain information as described in our Privacy Statements and our Terms of Use.<br>

<h3>WHAT TYPE OF LEGAL PROCESS DOES UBER REQUIRE BEFORE PRODUCING USER OR PARTNER INFORMATION?</h3><br>
For U.S. Law Enforcement We require valid and sufficient legal process before we can disclose business records regarding partners, 
users, or trips. In most instances, we won�t be able to provide any information without a valid subpoena, court order, or search 
warrant. We accept law enforcement requests via email to LERT@Share and Care.com or via personal service through our corporate agent,
National Registered Agents, Inc., 818 W. Seventh Street, Suite 930, Los Angeles, California 90017. Our acceptance of legal process 
does not waive any legal objections Uber may have and may raise in response to the request.

For Non-U.S. Law Enforcement: We disclose business records only in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. A valid 
U.S. court order (via mutual legal assistance treaty, mutual legal assistance agreement, or letter rogatory) may be required to 
compel disclosure of certain records. We accept non-US requests via email to LERT@Share and Care.com <br>

<h3>WHAT FORM OF REQUESTS DOES UBER REQUIRE, AND HOW ARE REQUESTS PROCESSED?</h3><br>
To respond to a request, we will need to receive the applicable process described above, as well as a valid return email address 
from an official government domain. We review each request for facial and substantive validity, and will reject requests that are 
not facially and substantively valid. Among other things, we require requests to be narrowly tailored to a legitimate law enforcement
need and will reject overly broad, vague, or unduly burdensome requests. In order to make sure your Law Enforcement Request is valid 
and does not seek more information than necessary, we ask for the following: A sufficiently narrow/defined time period; A specific 
event or action that the subject took; A specific reference (i.e., you must uniquely identify a user or driver partner) We disclose 
data to law enforcement when we determine that we are required to do so by law. In those instances, we will search for and disclose 
data that we are reasonably able to locate and retrieve.<br>

<h3>HOW DOES SHARE AND CARE HANDLE EMERGENCY REQUESTS?<h3></br>
We have a process for evaluating requests on an emergency basis where there is an emergency that involves protecting a user, driver 
partner, or third party or stopping illegal activity that poses an immediate threat of death or serious bodily harm. Requestors must 
submit an Emergency Request Form (which can be requested through LERT@Share and Care.com) that describes in detail the nature of the 
emergency,and we review these requests on a case-by-case basis. Law enforcement can submit an emergency request by emailing 
LERT@Share and Care.com. Please note that we will only review and respond to emergency requests from law enforcement, and will not 
respond to emergency requests sent to this address by non-law enforcement officials. Non-law enforcement officials aware of an 
emergency situation shouldimmediately and directly contact local law enforcement officials.<br>

<h3>DOES UBER NOTIFY INDIVIDUALS OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION RELATING TO THEM?</h3><br>
Yes, we may notify subjects before producing their information to law enforcement, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so, 
or in exceptional circumstances such as emergencies. Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an 
investigation should obtain an appropriate court order or other appropriate process establishing that notice is prohibited.<br>
