Share And Care operates, and processes personal data, globally; wherever and whenever you travel, your data travels with you so we 
can offer you a seamless experience. We also respect your data protection rights whether you are in your home country or elsewhere.
This means that we may transfer personal data to countries other than your home country in order to provide our services in a 
different country at your request. We may also transfer personal data to another country if that is necessary to respond to a 
customer support request that you submitted outside your region. And trip/order histories may be accessed by users in another country
after they have left the country where services were rendered. Because our services involve multiple users at the same time, limited 
personal data may be accessible to the other user in another country.

We do so in order to fulfill our agreements with all of our users, or based on users� instructions or prior consent, adequacy 
decisions for the relevant countries, or other transfer mechanisms as may be available under applicable law, such as the Standard 
Contractual Clauses.

We may also transfer data to other countries in order to respond to a request for personal data from a law enforcement agency. To 
provide additional safeguards to these data transfers, Uber applies a robust internal procedure for processing these requests. Share
And Care only discloses personal data to law enforcement agencies in a manner that is consistent with the regulatory requirements of 
applicable laws, such as the GDPR. You can find more information about requests from law enforcement here.

To help provide equivalent data protection wherever you use our services,Share And Care has implemented the following measures 
across the globe:
policies and procedures to limit access to, and the processing of personal data for defined purposes;
specific training of personnel responsible for managing personal data;
a government data access policy that refuses government access to data, except when disclosure is mandated by applicable laws 
including the EU GDPR, there is imminent risk of serious harm to individuals, or consent is obtained;
robust protection of data while it is in transit between Uber apps and our servers, and when the data is processed on our servers. 
This includes encryption and the use of pseudonymized data to help protect users' full identity against unauthorized disclosure.
For your convenience, the exercise of your data protection rights can be directed to Uber via any of the designated channels 
mentioned above, and will be handled centrally on behalf of the relevant controller. Questions, comments, and complaints about Share 
And Care�s data practices can be submitted here. You may also use this form to submit a question to Share And Care�s Data Protection

We may also infer demographic data from other data collected from users. For example, we may infer a user�s gender based on their 
first name to enable safety features, such as the Women Rider Preference, or to display personalized ads for third party products or 
services. See the section titled �How we use personal data� below for more information.<br>

We may also collect demographic data through user surveys.

safety, security, and fraud prevention, or by issues relating to the user�s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved 
claim or dispute.

for the life of users� accounts if such data is necessary to provide our services. E.g., user profile information and credentials.
for 7 years if necessary to comply with tax requirements. E.g., drivers� and delivery persons� trip or delivery location information.

year, and rejected driver applications for 7 years after requests for account deletion if necessary for purposes of safety, security,

regulatory requirements relating to drivers and delivery persons, this generally means that we retain their account and data for the
